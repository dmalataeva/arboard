## File Format

Arboard uses a simple JSON format (`.arb` extension) for easy interoperability:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "boards": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "name": "Board Name",
      "nodes": [
        {
          "id": "node-id",
          "name": "Person Name",
          "x": 100,
          "y": 150,
          "metadata": {
            "notes": "Optional notes"
          }
        }
      ],
      "connections": [
        {
          "id": "connection-id",
          "source": "source-node-id",
          "target": "target-node-id",
          "label": "Relationship Type",
          "connectionType": "unidirectional",
          "metadata": {
            "notes": "Optional notes"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "currentBoardId": "active-board-id"
}
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently, the app uses mouse/click interactions. Keyboard shortcuts may be added in future versions.

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Organize Your Layout**: Arrange nodes in a logical pattern (e.g., family tree, social circles)
2. **Use Descriptive Labels**: Clear relationship labels make graphs easier to understand
3. **Add Notes**: Use the notes field to store additional information about people or relationships
4. **Multiple Boards**: Separate different social circles or contexts into different boards
5. **Regular Saves**: Save your work to files periodically for backup
6. **Export Images**: Share your relationship maps by exporting as PNG
